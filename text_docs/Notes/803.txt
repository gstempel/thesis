Line 803: a misprint
Translators of Shade's poem are bound to have trouble with the transformation, at one
stroke, of "mountain" into "fountain": it cannot be rendered in French or German, or
Russian, or Zemblan; so the translator will have to put in it into one of those footnotes
that are the rogue's galleries of words. However! There exists to my knowledge one
absolutely extraordinary, unbelievably elegant case, where not only two, but three
words are involved. The story itself is trivial enough (and probably apocryphal). A
newspaper account of a Russian tsar's coronation had, instead of korona (crown), the
misprint vorona (crow), and when next day this was apologetically "corrected," it got
misprinted a second time as korova (cow). The artistic correlation between the crowncrow-cow series and the Russian korona-vorona-korova series is something that
would have, I am sure, enraptured my poet. I have seen nothing like it on lexical
playfields and the odds against the double coincidence defy computation.
