Lines 609-614: Nor can one help, etc.
This passage is different in the draft:

609

Nor can one help the exile caught by death
In a chance inn exposed to the hot breath
Of this America, this humid night:
Through slatted blinds the stripes of colored light
Grope for his bed - magicians from the past
With philtered gems - and life is ebbing fast.
This describes rather well the "chance inn," a log cabin, with a tiled bathroom, where
I am trying to coordinate these notes. At first I was greatly bothered by the blare of
diabolical radio music from what I thought was some kind of amusement park across
the road - it turned out to be camping tourists - and I was thinking of moving to
another place, when they forestalled me. Now it is quieter, except for an irritating
wind rattling through the withered aspens, and Cedarn is again a ghost town, and there
are no summer fools or spies to stare at me, and my little blue-jeaned fisherman no
longer stands on his stone in the stream, and perhaps it is better so.
