Line 929: Freud
In my mind's eye I see again the poet literally collapsing on his lawn, beating the
grass with his fist, and shaking and howling with laughter, and myself, Dr. Kinbote, a
torrent of tears streaming down my beard, as I try to read coherently certain tidbits
from a book I had filched from a classroom: a learned work on psychoanalysis, used
in American colleges, repeat, used in American colleges. Alas, I find only two items
preserved in my notebook:
By picking the nose in spite of all commands to the contrary, or when a youth is all
the time sticking his finger through his buttonhole... the analytic teacher knows that
the appetite of the lustful one knows no limit in his phantasies.
(Quoted by Prof. C. from Dr. Oskar Pfister, The Psychoanalytical Method, 1917, N.Y.,
p. 79)
The little cap of red velvet in the German version of Little Red Riding Hood is a
symbol of menstruation.
(Quoted by Prof. C. from Erich Fromm, The Forgotten Language, 1951, N.Y., p. 240.)
Do those clowns really believe what they teach?
