Line 231: How ludicrous, etc.
A beautiful variant, with one curious gap, branches off at this point in the draft (dated
July 6):

Strange Other World where all our still-born dwell,
And pets, revived, and invalids, grown well,

And minds that died before arriving there:
Poor old man Swift, poor -, poor Baudelaire

What might that dash stand for? Unless Shade gave prosodic value to the mute e in
"Baudelaire," which I am quite certain he would never have done in English verse (cp: "Rabelais," line 501), the name required here must scan as a trochee. Among the
names of celebrated poets, painters, philosophers, etc., known to have become insane
or to have sunk into senile imbecility, we find many suitable ones. Was Shade
confronted by too much variety with nothing to help logic choose and so left a blank,
relying upon the mysterious organic force that rescues poets to fill it in at its own
convenience? Or was there something else - some obscure intuition, some prophetic
scruple that prevented him from spelling out the name of an eminent man who
happened to be an intimate friend of his? Was he perhaps playing safe because a
reader in his household might have objected to that particular name being mentioned?
And if it comes to that, why mention it at all in this tragical context? Dark, disturbing
thoughts.
