Line 319: wood duck
A pretty conceit. The wood duck, a richly colored bird, emerald, amethyst, carnelian,
with black and white markings, is incomparably more beautiful than the muchoverrated swan, a serpentine goose with a dirty neck of yellowish plush and a
frogman's black rubber flaps.
Incidentally, the popular nomenclature of American animals reflects the simple
utilitarian minds of ignorant pioneers and has not yet acquired the patina of European
faunal names.
