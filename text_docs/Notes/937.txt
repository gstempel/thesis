Line 937: Old Zembla
I am a weary and sad commentator today.
Parallel to the left-hand side of this card (his seventy-sixth) the poet has written, on
the eve of his death, a line (from Pope's Second Epistle of the Essay on Man) that he
may have intended to cite in a footnote:

At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where

So this is all treacherous old Shade could say about Zembla - my Zembla? While
shaving his stubble off? Strange, strange...
