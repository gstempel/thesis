Line 57: The phantom of my little daughter's swing
After this Shade crossed out lightly the following lines in the draft:

The light is good; the reading lamps, long-necked;
All doors have keys. Your modern architect
Is in collusion with psychoanalysts:

When planning parents' bedrooms, he insists
On lockless doors so that, when looking back,
The future patient of the future quack
May find, all set for him, the Primal Scene.
