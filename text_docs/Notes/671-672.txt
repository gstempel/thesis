Line 662: Who rides so late in the night and the wind

This line, and indeed the whole passage (line 653-664), allude to the well-known
poem by Goethe about the erlking, hoary enchanter of the elf-haunted alderwood, who
falls in love with the delicate little boy of a belated traveler. One cannot sufficiently
admire the ingenious way in which Shade manages to transfer something of the
broken rhythm of the ballad (a trisyllabic meter at heart) into his iambic verse:

662

Who rídes so láte in the níght and the wínd

663

...........................................

664

.... Ít is the fáther with his chíld

Goethe's two lines opening the poem come out most exactly and beautifully, with the
bonus of an unexpected rhyme (also in French: vent - enfant), in my own language:

Ret wóren ok spoz on nátt ut vétt?
Éto est vótchez ut míd ik détt.

Another fabulous ruler, the last king of Zembla, kept repeating these haunting lines to
himself both in Zemblan and German, as a chance accompaniment of drumming
fatigue and anxiety, while he climbed through the bracken belt of the dark mountains
he had to traverse in his bid for freedom.
