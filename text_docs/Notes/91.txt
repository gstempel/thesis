John Shade allowed me one day to memorandum the first and the last of the series;
they happened to intercommunicate most pleasingly, I thought. Both stemmed from
the same family magazine Life, so justly famed for its pudibundity in regard to the
mysteries of the male sex; hence one can well imagine how startled or titillated those
families were. The first comes from the issue of May 10, 1937, p. 67, and advertises
the Talon Trouser Fastener (a rather grasping and painful name, by the way). It shows
a young gent radiating virility among several ecstatic lady-friends, and the inscription

reads: You'll be amazed that the fly of your trousers could be so dramatically
improved. The second comes from the issue of March 28, 1949, p. 126, and advertises
Hanes Fig Leaf Brief. It shows a modern Eve worshipfully peeping from behind a
potted tree of knowledge at a leering young Adam in rather ordinary but clean
underwear, with the front of his advertised brief conspicuously and compactly shaded,
and the inscription reads: Nothing beats a fig leaf.
