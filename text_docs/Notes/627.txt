Line 627: The great Starover Blue
Presumably, permission from Prof. Blue was obtained but even so the plunging of a
real person, no matter how sportive and willing, into an invented milieu where he is
made to perform in accordance with the invention, strikes one as a singularly tasteless
device, especially since other real-life characters, except members of the family, of
course, are pseudonymized in the poem.
This name, no doubt, is most tempting. The star over the blue eminently suits an
astronomer though actually neither his first nor second name bears any relation to the
celestial vault: the first was given him in memory of his grandfather, a Russian
starover (accented, incidentally, on the ultima), that is, Old Believer (member of a
schismatic sect), named Sinyavin, from siniy, Russ. "blue." This Sinyavin migrated
from Saratov to Seattle and begot a son who eventually changed his name to Blue and
married Stella Lazurchik, an Americanized Kashube. So it goes. Honest Starover Blue
will probably be surprised by the epithet bestowed upon him by a jesting Shade. The
writer feels moved to pay here a small tribute to the amiable old freak, adored by
everybody on the campus and nicknamed by the students Colonel Starbottle, evidently
because of his exceptionally convivial habits. After all, there were other great men in
our poet's entourage - for example, that distinguished Zemblan scholar Oscar
Nattochdag.
