Line 109: iridule
An iridescent cloudlet, Zemblan muderperlwelk. The term "iridule" is, I believe,
Shade's own invention. Above it, in the Fair Copy (card 9, July 4) he has written in
pencil. "peacock-herl." The peacock-herl is the body of a certain sort of artificial fly
also called "alder." So the owner of this motor court, an ardent fisherman, tells me.
(See also the "strange nacreous gleams" in line 634.)
