Lines 39-40: Was close my eyes, etc.
These lines are represented in the drafts by a variant reading:

........... and home would haste my thieves
The sun with stolen ice, the moon with leaves

One cannot help recalling a passage in Timon of Athens (Act IV, Scene 3) where the
misanthrope talks to the three marauders. Having no library in the desolate log cabin
where I live like Timon in his cave, I am compelled for the purpose of quick citation
to retranslate this passage into English prose from a Zemblan poetical version of
Timon which, I hope, sufficiently approximates the text, or is at least faithful to its
spirit:

The sun is a thief: she lures the sea
and robs it. The moon is a thief:
he steals his silvery light from the sun.
The sea is a thief: it dissolves the moon.

For a prudent appraisal of Conmal's translations of Shakespeare's works, see note to
line 962.
