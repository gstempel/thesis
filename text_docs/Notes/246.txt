Line 246: ... my dear
The poet addresses his wife. The passage devoted to her (lines 246-292) has its
structural use as a transition to the theme of his daughter. I can, however, state that
when dear Sybil's steps were heard upstairs, fierce and sharp, above our heads,
everything was not always "all right"!
