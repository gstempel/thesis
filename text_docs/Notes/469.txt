Line 469: his gun
Gradus, as he drove back to Geneva, wondered when he would be able to use it, that
gun. The afternoon was unbearably hot. The lake had developed a scaling of silver
and a touch of reflected thunderhead. As many old glaziers, he could deduce rather
accurately water temperature from certain indices of brilliancy and motion, and now
judged it to be at least 23Â°. As soon as he got back to his hotel he made a longdistance call to headquarters. It proved a terrible experience. Under the assumption
that it would attract less attention than a BIC language, the conspirators conducted
telephone conversations in English - broken English, to be exact, with one tense, no
articles, and two pronunciations, both wrong. Furthermore, by their following the
crafty system (invented in the chief BIC country) of using two different sets of code
words - headquarters, for instance, saying "bureau" for "king," and Gradus saying
"letter," they enormously increased the difficulty of communication. Each side, finally,
had forgotten the meaning of certain phrases pertaining to the other's vocabulary so
that in result, their tangled and expensive talk combined charades with an obstacle
race in the dark. Headquarters thought it understood that letters from the King
divulging his whereabouts could be obtained by breaking into Villa Disa and rifling
the Queen's bureau; Gradus, who had said nothing of the sort, but had merely tried to
convey the results of his Lex visit, was chagrined to learn that instead of looking for
the King in Nice he was expected to wait for a consignment of canned salmon in
Geneva. One thing, though, came out clearly: next time he should not telephone, but
wire or write.
