Line 119: Dr. Sutton
This is a recombination of letters taken from two names. one beginning in "Sut," the
other ending in "ton." Two distinguished medical men, long retired from practice,
dwelt, on our hill. Both were very old friends of the Shades; one had a daughter,
president of Sybil's club - and this is the Dr. Sutton I visualize in my notes to lines
181 and 1000. He is also mentioned in Line 986.
