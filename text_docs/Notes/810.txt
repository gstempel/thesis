Line 810: a web of sense
One of the five cabins of which this motor court consists is occupied by the owner, a
blear-eyed, seventy-year-old man whose twisted limp reminds me of Shade. He runs a
small gas station nearby, sells worms to fishermen, and usually does not bother me,
but the other day he suggested I "grab any old book" from the shelf in his room. Not
wishing to offend him, I cocked my head at them, to one side, and then to the other,
but they were all dog-eared paperback mystery stories and did not rate more than a
sigh and a smile. He said wait a minute-and took from a bedside recess a battered
clothbound treasure. "A great book by a great guy," the Letters of Franklin Lane.
"Used to see a lot of him in Rainier Park when I was a young ranger up there. You
take it for a couple of days. You won't regret it!"
I did not. Here is a passage that curiously echoes Shade's tone at the end of Canto
Three. It comes from a manuscript fragment written by Lane on May 17, 1921, on the
eve of his death, after a major operation: "And if I had passed into that other land,
whom would I have sought? ... Aristotle! - Ah, there would be a man to talk with!
What satisfaction to see him take, like reins from between his fingers, the long ribbon
of man's life and trace it through the mystifying maze of all the wonderful adventure ...
The crooked made straight. The Daedalian plan simplified by a look from above smeared out as it were by the splotch of some master thumb that made the whole
involuted, boggling thing one beautiful straight line."
Line 819: Playing a game of worlds
My illustrious friend showed a childish predilection for all sorts of word games and
especially for so-called word golf. He would interrupt the flow of a prismatic
conversation to indulge in this particular pastime, and naturally it would have been

boorish of me to refuse playing with him. Some of my records are: hate-love in three,
lass-male in four, and live-dead in five (with "lend" in the middle).
