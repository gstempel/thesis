Line 270: My dark Vanessa
It is so like the heart of a scholar in search of a fond name to pile a butterfly genus
upon an Orphic divinity on top of the inevitable allusion to Vanhomrigh, Esther! In
this connection a couple of lines from one of Swift's poems (which in these
backwoods I cannot locate) have stuck in my memory:

When, lo! Vanessa in her bloom
Advanced like Atalanta's star

As to the Vanessa butterfly, it will reappear in lines 993-995 (to which see note to lines 993-995).
Shade used to say that its Old English name was The Red Admirable, later degraded
to The Red Admiral. It is one of the few butterflies I happen to be familiar with.
Zemblans call it harvalda (the heraldic one) possibly because a recognizable figure of
it is borne in the escutcheon of the Dukes of Payn. In the autumn of certain years it
used to occur rather commonly in the Palace Gardens and visit the Michaelmas
daisies in company with a day-flying moth. I have seen The Red Admirable feasting
on oozy plums and, once, on a dead rabbit. It is a most frolicsome fly. An almost tame
specimen of it was the last natural object John Shade pointed out to me as he walked
to his doom (see note to lines 993-995).
I notice a whiff of Swift in some of my notes. I too am a desponder in my nature, an
uneasy, peevish, and suspicious man, although I have my moments of volatility and
fou rire.
