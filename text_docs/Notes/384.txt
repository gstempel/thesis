Line 384: book on Pope
The title of this work which can be found in any college library is Supremely Blest, a
phrase borrowed from a Popian line, which I remember but cannot quote exactly. The
book is concerned mainly with Pope's technique but also contains pithy observations
on "the stylized morals of his age."
