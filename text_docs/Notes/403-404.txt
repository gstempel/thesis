Line 403-404: it's eight fifteen (And here time forked)
From here to line 474 two themes alternate in a synchronous arrangement: television
in the Shades' parlor and the replay, as it were, of Hazel's (already adumbrated)
actions from the moment Peter met his blind date (406-407) and apologized for
having to leave in a hurry (426-428) to Hazel's ride in the bus (445-447 and 457-460),
ending with the watchman's finding her body (474-477). I have italicized the Hazel
theme.
The whole thing strikes me as too labored and long, especially since the
synchronization device has been already worked to death by Flaubert and Joyce.
Otherwise the pattern is exquisite.
