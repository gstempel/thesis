Lines 597-608: the thoughts we should roll-call, etc.
This passage should be associated in the reader's mind with the extraordinary variant
given in the preceding note, for only a week later Tanagra dust and "our royal hands"
were to come together, in real life, in real death.
Had he not fled, our Charles II might have been executed; this would have certainly
happened had he been apprehended between the palace and the Rippleson Caves; but
he sensed those thick fingers of fate only seldom during his flight; he sensed them
feeling for him (as those of a grim old shepherd checking a daughter's virginity) when
he was slipping, that night, on the damp ferny flank of Mt. Mandevil (see note to line 149), and next day, at a more eerie altitude, in the heady blue, where the mountaineer
becomes aware of a phantom companion. Many times that night our King cast himself
upon the ground with the desperate resolution of resting there till dawn that he might
shift with less torment what hazard soever he ran. (I am thinking of yet another
Charles, another long dark man above two yards high.) But it was all rather physical,
or neurotic, and I know perfectly well that my King, if caught and condemned and led
away to be shot, would have behaved as he does in lines 606-608: thus he would look
about him with insolent composure, and thus he would

Taunt our inferiors, cheerfully deride
The dedicated imbeciles and spit
Into their eyes just for the fun of it

Let me close this important note with a rather anti-Darwinian aphorism: The one who
kills is always his victim's inferior.
Line 603: Listen to distant cocks crow
One will recall the admirable image in a recent poem by Edsel Ford:

And often when the cock crew, shaking fire
Out of the morning and the misty mow

A mow (in Zemblan muwan) is the field next to a barn.
