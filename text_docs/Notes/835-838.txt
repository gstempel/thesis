Lines 835-838: Now I shall spy, etc.
The canto, begun on July 19th, on card sixty-eight, opens with a typical Shadism: the
cunning working-in of several inter-echoing phrases into a jumble of enjambments.
Actually, the promise made in these four lines will not be really kept except for the
repetition of their incantatory rhythm in lines 915 and 923-924 (leading to the savage
attack in 925-930). The poet like a fiery rooster seems to flap his wings in a
preparatory burst of would-be inspiration, but the sun does not rise. Instead of the
wild poetry promised here, we get a jest or two, a bit of satire, and at the end of the
canto, a wonderful radiance of tenderness and repose.
