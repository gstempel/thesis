Lines 90-93: Her room, etc.
In the draft, instead of the final text:

............. her room
We've kept intact. Her trivia for us
Retrace her style: the leaf sarcophagus
(A Luna's dead and shriveled-up cocoon)

The reference is to what my dictionary defines as "a large, tailed, pale green moth, the
caterpillar of which feeds on the hickory." I suspect Shade altered this passage
because his moth's name clashed with "Moon" in the next line.
