Line 502: The grand potato
An execrable pun, deliberately placed in this epigraphic position to stress lack of
respect for Death. I remember from my schoolroom days Rabelais' soi-disant "last
words" among other bright bits in some French manual: Je m'en vais chercher le
grand peut-Ãªtre.
Line 502: IPH
Good taste and the law of libel prevent me from disclosing the real name of the
respectable institute of higher philosophy at which our poet pokes a good deal of
fanciful fun in this canto. Its terminal initials, HP, provide its students with the
abbreviation Hi-Phi, and Shade neatly parodies this in his IPH, or If, combinations. It
is situated, most picturesquely, in a southwestern state that must remain anonymous
here.
I am also obliged to observe that I strongly disapprove of the flippancy with which
our poet treats, in this canto, certain aspects of spiritual hope which religion alone can
fulfill (see also note to 549).
