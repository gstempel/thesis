Line 247: Sybil
John Shade's wife, nee Irondell (which comes not from a little valley yielding iron ore
but from the French for "swallow"). She was a few months his senior. I understand
she came of Canadian stock, as did Shade's maternal grandmother (a first cousin of
Sybil's grandfather, if I am not greatly mistaken).

From the very first I tried to behave with the utmost courtesy toward my friend's wife,
and from the very first she disliked and distrusted me. I was to learn later that when
alluding to me in public she used to call me "an elephantine tick; a king-sized botfly;
a macaco worm; the monstrous parasite of a genius." I pardon her - her and everybody.
