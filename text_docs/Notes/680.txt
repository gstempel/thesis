Line 680: Lolita
Major hurricanes are given feminine names in America. The feminine gender is
suggested not so much by the sex of furies and harridans as by a general professional
application. Thus any machine is a she to its fond user, and any fire (even a "pale"
one!) is she to the fireman, as water is she to the passionate plumber. Why our poet
chose to give his 1958 hurricane a little-used Spanish name (sometimes given to
parrots) instead of Linda or Lois, is not clear.
