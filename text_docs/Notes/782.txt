Line 782: your poem
An image of Mont Blanc's "blue-shaded buttresses and sun-creamed domes" is
fleetingly glimpsed through the cloud of that particular poem which I wish I could
quote but do not have at hand. The "white mountain" of the lady's dream, caused by a
misprint to tally with Shade's "white fountain," makes a thematic appearance here,
blurred as it were by the lady's grotesque pronunciation.
