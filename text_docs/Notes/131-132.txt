Lines 131-132: I was the shadow of the waxwing slain by feigned remoteness in the
windowpane.
The exquisite melody of the two lines opening the poem is picked up here. The
repetition of that long-drawn note is saved from monotony by the subtle variation in
fine 132 where the assonance. between its second word and the rhyme gives the ear a
kind of languorous pleasure as would the echo of some half-remembered sorrowful
song whose strain is more meaningful than its words. Today, where the "feigned
remoteness" has indeed performed its dreadful duty, and the poem we have is the only
"shadow" that remains, we cannot help reading into these lines something more than
mirrorplay and mirage shimmer. We feel doom, in the image of Gradus, eating away
the miles and miles of "feigned remoteness" between him and poor Shade. He, too, is
to meet, in his urgent and blind flight, a reflection that will shatter him.
Although Gradus availed himself of all varieties of locomotion - rented cars, local
trains, escalators, airplanes - somehow the eye of the mind sees him, and the muscles
of the mind feel him, as always streaking across the sky with black traveling bag in
one hand and loosely folded umbrella in the other, in a sustained glide high over sea
and land. The force propelling him is the magic action of Shade's poem itself, the very
mechanism and sweep of verse, the powerful iambic motor. Never before has the
inexorable advance of fate received such a sensuous form (for other images of that
transcendental tramp's approach see note to line 17).
