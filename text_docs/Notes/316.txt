Line 316: The Toothwort White haunted our woods in May
Frankly, I am not certain what this means. My dictionary defines "toothwort" as "a
kind of cress" and the noun "white" as "any pure white breed of farm animal or a
certain genus of lepidoptera." Little help is provided by the variant written in the
margin:

In woods Virginia Whites occurred in May

Folklore characters, perhaps? Fairies? Or cabbage butterflies?
