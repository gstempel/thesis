Line 162: With his pure tongue, etc.
This is a singularly roundabout way of describing a country girl's shy kiss; but the
whole passage is very baroque. My own boyhood was too happy and healthy to
contain anything remotely like the fainting fits experienced by Shade: It must have
been with him a mild form of epilepsy, a derailment of the nerves at the same spot, on
the same curve of the tracks, every day, for several weeks, until nature repaired the
damage. Who can forget the good-natured faces, glossy with sweat, of copper-chested
railway workers leaning upon their spades and following with their eyes the windows
of the great express cautiously gliding by?
