Lines 895-899: The more I weigh ... or this dewlap
Instead of these facile and revolting lines, the draft gives:

895

I have a certain liking, I admit,
For Parody, that last resort of wit:
"In nature's strife when fortitude prevails

The victim falters and the victor fails."
899

Yes, reader, Pope
