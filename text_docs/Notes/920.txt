Line 920: little hairs stand on end
Alfred Housman (1859-1936), whose collection The Shropshire Lad vies with the In
Memoriam of Alfred Tennyson (1809-1892) in representing, perhaps (no, delete this
craven "perhaps"), the highest achievement of English poetry in a hundred years, says
somewhere (in a foreword?) exactly the opposite: The bristling of thrilled little hairs
obstructed his barbering:, but since both Alfreds certainly used an Ordinary Razor,
and John Shade an ancient Gillette, the discrepancy may have been due to the use of
different instruments.
