Although it may be taken to refer to the man (whoever he was) who occupied this post
at the time Hazel Shade was a student, the reader cannot be blamed for applying it to
Paul H., Jr., the fine administrator and inept scholar who since 1957 headed the
English Department of Wordsmith College. We met now and then (see Foreword and see note to line 894) but not often. The Head of the Department to which I belonged was
Prof. Nattochdag - "Netochka" as we called the dear man. Certainly the migraines that
have lately tormented me to such a degree that I once had to leave in the midst of a
concert at which I happened to be sitting beside Paul H., Jr., should not have been a
stranger's business. They apparently were, very much so. He kept his eye on me, and
immediately upon John Shade's demise circulated a mimeographed letter that began:
Several members of the Department of English are painfully concerned over the fate
of a manuscript poem, or parts of a manuscript poem, left by the late John Shade. The
manuscript fell into the hands of a person who not only is unqualified for the job of
editing it, belonging as he does to another department, but is known to have a
deranged mind. One wonders whether some legal action, etc.
"Legal action," of course, might be taken by somebody else too. But no matter; one's
just anger is mitigated by the satisfaction of foreknowing that the engag√© gentleman
will be less worried about the fate of my friend's poem after reading the passage

commented here. Southey liked a roasted rat for supper - which is especially comic in
view of the rats that devoured his Bishop.
