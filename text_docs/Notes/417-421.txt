Line 417-421: I went upstairs, etc.
The draft yields an interesting variant:

417

I fled upstairs at the first quawk of jazz
And read a galley proof: "Such verses as
'See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing,
The sot a hero, lunatic a king'
Smack of their heartless age." Then came your call

This is, of course, from Pope's Essay on Man. One knows not what to wonder at more:
Pope's not finding a monosyllable to replace "hero" (for example, "man") so as to
accommodate the definite article before the next word, or Shade's replacing an

admirable passage by the much flabbier final text. Or was he afraid of offending an
authentic king? In pondering the near past I have never been able to ascertain
retrospectively if he really had "guessed my secret," as he once observed (see note to line 991).
