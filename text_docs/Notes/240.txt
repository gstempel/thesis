Line 240: That Englishman in Nice
The sea gulls of 1933 are all dead, of course. But by inserting a notice in The London
Times one might procure the name of their benefactor - unless Shade invented him.
When I visited Nice a quarter of a century later, there was, in lieu of that Englishman,
a local character, an old bearded bum, tolerated or abetted as a tourist attraction, who
stood like a statue of Verlaine with an unfastidious sea gull perched in profile on his
matted hair, or took naps in the public sun, comfortably curled up with his back to the
lulling roll of the sea, on a promenade bench, under which he had neatly arranged to
dry, or ferment, multicolored gobbets of undeterminable victuals on a newspaper. Not
many Englishmen walked there, anyway, though I noticed quite a few just east of
Mentone; on the quay where in honor of Queen Victoria a bulky monument, with
difficulty embraced by the breeze, had been erected, but not yet unshrouded, to
replace the one the Germans had taken away. Rather pathetically, the eager horn of
her pet monoceros protruded through the shroud.
