Lines 86-90: Aunt Maud
Maud Shade, 1869-1950, Samuel Shade's sister. At her death, Hazel (born 1934) was
not exactly a "babe" as implied in line 90. I found her paintings unpleasant but
interesting. Aunt Maud was far from spinsterish, and the extravagant and sardonic
turn of her mind must have shocked sometimes the genteel dames of New Wye.
