Lines 385-386: Jane Dean, Pete Dean
The transparent pseudonyms of two innocent people. I visited Jane Provost when
passing through Chicago in August. I found her still unmarried. She showed me some
amusing photos of her cousin Peter and his friends. She told me - and I have no reason
to disbelieve her words - that Peter Provost (whom I desired very very much to meet,
but he was, alas, selling automobiles in Detroit) might have exaggerated a wee bit, but
certainly did not fib, when explaining that he had to keep a promise made to one of
his dearest fraternity friends, a glorious young athlete whose "garland" will not, one
hopes, be "briefer than a girl's." Such obligations are not to be treated lightly or
disdainfully. Jane said she had tried to talk to the Shades after the tragedy, and later
had written Sybil a long letter that was never acknowledged. I said, displaying a bit of
the slang I had recently started to master: "You are telling me!"
