Line 275: We have been married forty years
John Shade and Sybil Swallow (see note to line 247) were married in 1919, exactly
three decades before King Charles wed Disa, Duchess of Payn. Since the very
beginning of his reign (1936-1958) representatives of the nation, salmon fishermen,
non-union glaziers, military groups; worried relatives, and especially the Bishop of
Yeslove, a sanguineous and saintly old man, had been doing their utmost to persuade
him to give up his copious but sterile pleasures and take a wife. It was a matter not of
morality but of succession. As in the case of some of his predecessors, rough
alderkings who burned for boys, the clergy blandly ignored our young bachelor's
pagan habits, but wanted him to do what an earlier and even more reluctant Charles
had done: take a night off and lawfully engender an heir.
He saw nineteen-year-old Disa for the first time on the festive night of July the 5th,
1947, at a masked ball in his uncle's palace. She had come in male dress, as a Tirolese
boy, a little knock-kneed but brave and lovely, and afterwards he drove her and her
cousins (two guardsmen disguised as flower-girls) in his divine new convertible
through the streets to see the tremendous birthday illumination, and the fackeltanz in
the park, and the fireworks, and the pale upturned faces. He procrastinated for almost
two years but was set upon by inhumanly eloquent advisers, and finally gave in. On
the eve of his wedding he prayed most of the night locked up all alone in the cold
vastness of the Onhava cathedral. Smug alderkings looked at him from the ruby-andamethyst windows. Never had he so fervently asked God for guidance and strength
(see note to lines 433-434).
After line 274 there is a false start in the draft:

I like my name: Shade, Ombre, almost "man"
In Spanish...

One regrets that the poet did not pursue this theme - and spare his reader the
embarrassing intimacies that follow.
