Line 550: debris
I wish to say something about an earlier note (to line 12). Conscience and scholarship
have debated the question, and I now think that the two lines given in that note are
distorted and tainted by wistful thinking. It is the only time in the course of the
writing of these difficult comments, that I have tarried, in my distress and
disappointment, on the brink of falsification. I must ask the reader to ignore those two
lines (which, I am afraid, do not even scan properly). I could strike them out before
publication but that would mean reworking the entire note, or at least a considerable
part of it, and I have no time for such stupidities.
