Line 92: the paperweight
The image of those old-fashioned horrors strangely haunted our poet. I have clipped
from a newspaper that recently reprinted it an old poem of his where the souvenir
shop also preserves a landscape admired by the tourist:

MOUNTAIN VIEW

Between the mountain and the eye
The spirit of the distance draws
A veil of blue amorous gauze,
The very texture of the sky.
A breeze reaches the pines, and I
Join in the general applause.
But we all know it cannot last,
The mountain is too weak to wait Even if reproduced and glassed
In me as in a paperweight.
