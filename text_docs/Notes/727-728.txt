Lines 727-728: No, Mr. Shade ... just half a shade
Another fine example of our poet's special brand of combinational magic. The subtle
pun here turns on two additional meanings of "shade" besides the obvious synonym of
"nuance." The doctor is made to suggest that not only did Shade retain in his trance
half of his identity but that he was also half a ghost. Knowing the particular medical
man who treated my friend at the time; I venture to add that he is far too, stodgy to
have displayed any such wit.
