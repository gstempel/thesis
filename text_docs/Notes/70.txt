Line 70: The new TV
After this, in the draft (dated July 3), come a few unnumbered lines that may have
been intended for some later parts of. the poem. They are not actually deleted but are
accompaied by a question mark in the margin and encircled with a wavy line
encroaching upon some of the letters:

There are events, strange happenings, that strike
The mind as emblematic. They are like
Lost similes adrift without a string,
Attached to nothing. Thus that northern king,
Whose desperate escape from prison was
Brought off successfully only because
Some forty of his followers that night
Impersonated him and aped his flight -

He never would have reached the western coast had not a fad spread among his secret
supporters, romantic, heroic daredevils, of impersonating the fleeing king. They
rigged themselves out to look like him in red sweaters and red caps, and popped up
here and there, completely bewildering the revolutionary police. Some of the
pranksters were much younger than the King, but this did not matter since his pictures
in the huts of mountain folks and in the myopic shops of hamlets, where you could
buy worms, ginger bread and zhiletka blades, had not aged since his coronation. A
charming cartoon touch was added on the famous occasion when from the terrace of
the Kronblik Hotel, whose chairlift takes tourists to the Kron glacier, one merry mime
was seen floating up, like a red moth, with a hapless, and capless, policeman riding
two seats behind him in dream-slow pursuit. It gives one pleasure to add that before
reaching the staging point, the false king managed to escape by climbing down one of
the pylons that supported the traction cable (see also notes to lines 149 and 171).
