One minute before his death, as we were crossing from his demesne to mine and had
begun working up between the junipers and ornamental shrubs, a Red Admirable (see note to line 270) came dizzily whirling around us like a colored flame. Once or twice
before we had already noticed the same individual, at that same time, on that same
spot, where the low sun finding an aperture in the foliage splashed the brown sand
with a last radiance while the evening's shade covered the rest of the path. One's eyes
could not follow the rapid butterfly in the sunbeams as it flashed and vanished, and
flashed again, with an almost frightening imitation of conscious play which now
culminated in its setting upon my delighted friend's sleeve. It took off, and we saw it
next morning sporting in an ecstasy of frivolous haste around a laurel shrub, every
now and then perching on a lacquered leaf and sliding down its grooved middle like a
boy down the banister on his birthday. Then the tide of the shade reached the laurels,
and the magnificent, velvet-and-flame creature dissolved in it.
